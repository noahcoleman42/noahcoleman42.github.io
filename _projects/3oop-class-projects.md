Here are a few projects made in my object oriented programming class. 

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
-----
This is a text based implementation of the classic game from _The Big Bang Theory_. As explained in this [video](https://youtu.be/x5Q6-wMx-K8?t=19), the game of rock paper scissors lizard spock has a number of rules to follow that are best understood visually. The following diagram demonstrates how points are scored.

The game is played as follows:

1. The player chooses a hand either numerically by choosing a number between 1 and 5, or by entering the name of the hand shape chosen.
2. The computer randomly chooses a shape to throw
3. The round winner is determined
4. A point is awarded to the winner of the round.
5. Gameplay continues until either the player or the computer reach 3 rounds won in which the winner of the game is determined.

Gameplay:

Speech Synthesizer
-----
Hearing computer voices always feels strange to me. The words are familiar yet their tempo and articulation is unlike any spoken English I have ever heard. This dissociation leads to a general sense of eerieness, perfect for your next halloween party or other spooky occasion.

This program implements a speech sythesizer to read a song's lyrics from a .txt file.
