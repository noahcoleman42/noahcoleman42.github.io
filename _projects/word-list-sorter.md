This project was made to aid me in learning to type faster. And by that I don't mean learning to type faster, I mean learning to type... faster. For too long, I have been guilty of all the big typing sins: looking between the keyboard and the monitor, hunting-and-pecking for keys, not using my right pinky, but no longer. I started my learning journey on <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">this</a> website where I learned how to touch type. I then moved to other sites to improve my speed and accuracy. I soon noticed, however, that a lot of the words I knew well were being repeated, and the process felt inefficient. This is where my program came in. I used <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">this site</a> to discover which words took longer for me to type and compiled them into a list. On <a href="https://10fastfingers.com/">this website</a>, there is a form where you can enter a custom word list to practice specific words. Utilizing both websites with my program, I was able to practice the words that I was least familiar with.
