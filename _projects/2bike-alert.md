This project was inspired by a love for cycling and a realization of the many distractions cyclists face. Cyclists are often distracted by advertisements and commotion on the road, and to pedestrians, a distracted cyclist can be a serious hazard. Thousands of pedestrians are injured by cyclists in major US cities every year. Until cities build and maintain proper cycling infrastructure, pedestrians will continue to fall victim to distracted cyclists. This is where our project comes in.
