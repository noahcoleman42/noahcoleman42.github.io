What is a web scraper?
-----
Web scrapers are programs that extract content from a website. They are used to automate the process of gathering data. In general, they are used by companies to collect data about potential customers or clients. Think product reviews and social media posts. Companies collect data from different social media websites to see what is trending and learn how to better promote their products or services. Web scrapers can also be used to gather product listings. The real estate industry uses web scrapers to collect data about listed properties, gaining a better understanding of the market. Web scrapers can automate the monotonous task of sorting through property listings and aid realtors in striking bargains.

Why I made one
-----
This project was inspired by the desire to save time while browsing on Craigslist. The process of clicking in and out of listings and reading descriptions can be time consuming. I wanted to create a program that would save the price, date, and title of all the listings, and from there I could go through my condensed format and find what suited my needs. 

How I made it
-----
learned selenium's python package first
wrote a console application in c#
used console application code to make ASP.NET site.
